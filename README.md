# LLM-Agentic-Code-Instructions

A community-driven repository for best-practice, multi-contributor "instruction" files tailored for Large Language Model (LLM) coding agents like Claude-code, Codex, and others. These files help guide code generation, enforce standards, and improve project consistency when using agentic code tools.

---

## üöÄ What is This?

This repository is a central place for high-quality, community-curated instruction files that teach LLM-based coding agents how to write code for specific languages, frameworks, or projects.

- **Instruction files** help LLMs like Claude, Codex, etc., generate code that matches your team's standards and practices.
- Contributions welcome for any language, framework, or use case!

## ü§ñ Supported LLM Coding Agents

- [Claude-code by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
- [OpenAI Codex](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code)
- ...and others! PRs for more agent instructions encouraged.

## üìö Usage Instructions

### For Claude-code

1. **Where to Place Instruction Files**
   Place relevant instruction files in your project repository under:
   ```
   /instructions/claude/
   ```
   Example: `/instructions/claude/ruby-best-practices.md`

2. **How to Use**
   - When initializing your Claude agent for a project, load or reference the appropriate file(s) from `/instructions/claude/`.
   - Optionally, summarize or paste file contents into Claude's system prompt or context window.

3. **Project-Specific Instructions**
   - For project-specific conventions, add a file in `/instructions/claude/project-name.md`.

### For Codex (OpenAI)

1. **Where to Place Instruction Files**
   Place instruction files in your project repository under:
   ```
   /instructions/codex/
   ```
   Example: `/instructions/codex/python-flask-best-practices.md`

2. **How to Use**
   - When setting up your prompt, include the most relevant instruction file content at the start of your prompt, or reference it in your application logic.
   - For best results, keep the instruction files concise and focused.

3. **Project-Specific Instructions**
   - Add custom files in `/instructions/codex/project-name.md` for unique project standards.
