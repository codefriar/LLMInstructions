# LLM-Agentic-Code-Instructions

A community-driven repository for best-practice, multi-contributor "instruction" files tailored for Large Language Model (LLM) coding agents such as Claude-code, Codex, and others. These files help guide code generation, enforce standards, and improve project consistency when using agentic code tools.

---

## üöÄ What is This?

This repository is a central location for high-quality, community-curated instruction files that teach LLM-based coding agents how to write code for specific languages, frameworks, or projects.

***Instruction files*** help LLMs like Claude, Codex, and others generate code that matches your team's standards and practices.
Contributions are welcome for any language, framework, or use case!

## üìö Usage Instructions

### For Claude-code

1. **Where to Place Instruction Files**
   Place relevant instruction files in your project repository under:
   ```
   CLAUDE.md
   ```
   Example: `CLAUDE.md`

2. **How to Use**
   - When initializing your Claude agent for a project, load or reference the appropriate file(s) from `/Language-Name/Vendor.md`.
   - Optionally, summarize or paste file contents into Claude's system prompt or context window.

### For Codex (OpenAI)

1. **Where to Place Instruction Files**
   Place instruction files in your project repository root:
   ```
   AGENTS.md
   ```
   Example: `AGENT.md`

2. **How to Use(Advanced)**
   - place your LLM specific instruction file in the appropriate place within your project directory. For specific instructions per LLM vendor, keep reading.

3. **Vendor Specific Instructions**
    - **OpenAI Codex**
        - copy this repo's Language-Name/AGENTS.md file to:
            - ~/.codex/AGENTS.md - personal global guidance
            - AGENTS.md at your projects checkout root - shared project notes
            - AGENTS.md in the current working directory - sub-folder/feature specifics
    - **Anthropic Claude**
